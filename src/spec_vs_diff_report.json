However, the diff does not show the required new photographic image assets being added under frontend/public/assets/generated, and it’s not possible to verify the Products card uses object-cover from the provided changes.",

      "requirement": "All product images are served as static assets from frontend/public/assets/generated (referenced via /assets/generated/...)",
      "reason": "While ProductsSection.tsx now references /assets/generated/spice-photo-*.png, the diff shows no new static image files added under frontend/public/assets/generated, so the required photographic assets may be missing (risk of broken images).",

      "reason": "ProductsSection.tsx switches to photographic image URLs, but the diff does not include ProductCard.tsx (where object-cover would typically be applied) nor any confirmation that the referenced assets exist, so object-cover and non-broken rendering cannot be verified from the provided diff summary.",
